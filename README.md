# SRank Sample Datasets: Social Representations of "Science"

This repository contains the datasets used to illustrate the practical application of the **SRank** tool. 

## 📂 Dataset Description

The data consists of hierarchical evocations collected from undergraduate students in science teacher education programs (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology) at Brazilian public universities. The inducing word used for the evocations was **"Science"**.

The repository includes two main groups:
1.  **Junior Students:** Data from 46 first-year students.
2.  **Senior Students:** Data from 127 students in their final years (4th and 5th years) of the program.

## 📊 Data Format

The files are provided in formats compatible with the SRank web application (**XLSX** or **CSV**). The data is organized as follows:

*   **ID:** A unique code identifying each respondent.
*   **Word_1 to Word_5:** The sequence of evoked categories sorted in decreasing order of importance (from the most important to the least important).

**Note:** The original words evoked by respondents were grouped into categories of similar meanings by the authors before being organized into these files.

## 🛠️ How to Use

These datasets are intended to be used with the **SRank** web application to perform global ranking and consistency analysis based on Central Core Theory.

1.  Access the app at: [srankweb.streamlit.app](https://srankweb.streamlit.app/).
2.  Upload the desired file (`juniors` or `seniors`).
3.  Follow the interactive steps to generate the optimal global ranking and the **Residual Graphs**.
